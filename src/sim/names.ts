 * Deliberately unisex. Customer *appearance* is derived from this name via
 * `customerLookIndex`, and the cast varies in gender presentation, so a first name
 * that reads as strongly gendered would sooner or later be printed on an ID card
 * beside a portrait that contradicts it — which players read as a bug rather than
 * as diversity.
 *
 * Keeping the pool neutral is what makes the decoupling safe: there is no gender
 * in the name to disagree with. Adding a strongly gendered given name here would
 * silently break that, so add only names that sit comfortably on anyone.
